# scoreKeeper
Score board tool made with Vue.js

Build on top of the much cleaner, pure bootstrap, [version from oli8](https://github.com/Oli8/scoreKeeper)

This version only used a step-size of one point, but it adds a button to give three points at once. It also has a completely different design.

The live version will have pre-defined team-names, at the moment these are used to quickly use the gh-pages site for the score-keeping on the Regional scouting game West Brabant.
